# React Portfolio

## Description
Portolio refactor using react with a redesigned layout 

## Technologies
This app was completely frontend, using react that serves HTML and CSS. React-router was used to make routing simpler and maintain my sanity. I used Material Design Bootstrap for the CSS framework since it's  much easier to implement gradients.

## Challenges
Overall this was extremely simple. Setting up the react routes were pretty simple and the rest was just messing with design and styling. The one thing that was super annoying was getting the navbar to be vertical on the side. I had to add way too much custom css considering I was using a css framework.
